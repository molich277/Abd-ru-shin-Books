                    Abd-ru-shin's work "In the Light of Truth" – The Grail Message – conveys to the reader an insight into the working of the Laws of Nature and of Creation. In a comprehensible manner the author describes the working of the different Laws which are interwoven right up to the finest ramifications. As an example, the effect of a grain of corn bringing forth a multiple harvest of corn follows a pattern according to the laws. However, this principle of nature is not restricted to the world of plants alone, but the lawful effects also return to the human being as a consequence of the thoughts and deeds generated by him. Man harvests many times over from the seed which arises from his volition, and such a harvest can then bring him joy or sorrow. In this regard however, the thought that the personality of a human being is restricted to only a single earth life must however, be broadened, for the human being is a wanderer who has lived on this planet earth in several embodiments as a human being. Thus, what happened on this earth in the dim and distant past was the work of present day human beings, for we were also involved in these epochs in earlier incarnations.

                <p class="text-justify mb-3">
                    The themes Abd-ru-shin illuminates in His Work encompass the meaning of life and the task humanity on earth has to fulfil. Furthermore, the difference in the nature of man and woman is explained, in which particularly everything womanly finds expression in a manner which is finer and striving towards the Light.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify mb-4">
                    If he follows the descriptions of Abd-ru-shin with an open mind, the reader arrives at a basis for the ability to perceive that which the different cultures on this earth call "God". God, as the Creator of all things, in His Creation becomes truly perceptible only to those human beings who adapt themselves unconditionally to this Creation and the Laws active therein. In this connection, there can be no separation between belief and science for both have the same origin and require an objective examination which can only take place free from any sort of restraints in order to grasp them.
